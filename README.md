# Temporal Model Ensemble for Semi-Supervised Object Detection

This is th code for TME-SS


## Introducetion

we propose the temporal model ensemble based semi-supervised object detection. In order to obtain a feasible semi-supervised object detection model, we adapt the standard teacher-student architecture. The teacher model guides the student model producing similar predictions on unlabeled data. We propose the temporal model ensemble (TME) module to construct the teacher model.
